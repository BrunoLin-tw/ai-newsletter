## 📺 The Ad Wars: ChatGPT vs. Claude

The battle for AI assistant dominance took to the **Super Bowl** this week, with two starkly different strategies:

### OpenAI: Ads Are Coming
OpenAI has begun testing advertisements in ChatGPT with reported **$60 CPM rates** — among the highest in digital advertising. The company is positioning sponsored responses as a new revenue stream.

### Anthropic: The Ad-Free Alternative
In a brilliant counter-marketing move, Anthropic aired **two Super Bowl commercials** with the tagline: *"Ads are coming to AI. But not to Claude."* The campaign explicitly positions Claude as the premium, ad-free alternative for users and businesses.

Demis Hassabis (DeepMind CEO) expressed surprise at OpenAI's early monetization move, noting Gemini has "no plans" for ads at this time.
